# IPL Winning Team Predictor System

A machine learning project developed as part of the **AI/ML Internship at InternPe**, focusing on analyzing historical Indian Premier League (IPL) match data to build a predictive model capable of determining the **probable winning team** based on match-related features.  
This project demonstrates the application of sports analytics, machine learning classification models, and data preprocessing techniques on real-world cricket data.

---

## Overview

The project aims to:

- Analyze IPL historical match data  
- Clean, preprocess, and transform raw data  
- Encode categorical features such as team names, venue, and toss winner  
- Select relevant match features for accurate predictions  
- Build classification models to predict winning outcomes  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy score  
- Predict winning teams based on real match scenarios  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Models:** Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost optional)

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   - Understanding IPL match attributes and correlations  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing data  
   - Label encoding categorical features (teams, venue, toss winner)  
   - Selecting important match variables  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms implemented:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Random Forest Classifier  
     - Decision Tree Classifier  
     - XGBoost (optional)  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Statistical evaluation of predictions  

5. **Outcome Prediction**  
   - Model predicts the winning team based on inputs such as:  
     - Team 1  
     - Team 2  
     - Toss Winner  
     - Venue
